1. Place the chocolate chips in the blender. Crack in the eggs, then  add the vanilla and the salt. Pulse 5 to 7 times, or until the  chocolate chips are partially pulverized. 
2. Turn on the blender, then pour in the very hot coffee through the  hole in the top in a steady stream. The coffee will melt the  chocolate and turn it into a smooth mixture. 
3. Pour the mixture into small mason jars, pretty wine glasses or  demitasse cups. Place the jars on a tray and refrigerate them for 2  to 3 hours, or until firm. 
4. Whip the cream with the sugar and plop it onto the top of each  glass.
